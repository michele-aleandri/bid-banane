Puerto Banana – Rules (2–6 players)

Goal:
Be the first player to reach 200 bananas (stock points). If multiple players reach 200+ in the same round, they share the victory.

Setup:
- Each player starts with 10 bananas (stock).
- Place all players’ markers (or tokens) on their stock values.

Rounds:
Each round follows the same sequence:

1. Determine the Auction Amount
   - The number of bananas up for auction this round equals the highest stock currently held by any player.

2. Secret Bidding
   - All players bid any non-negative whole number (≥ 0).
   - Bids are secret until everyone is ready, then revealed simultaneously.
   - Players do not pay bananas to make a bid.

3. Resolve the Auction
   There are three cases:

   A. Tie for Highest Bid
      - The tied players split the auction amount equally (round down).
      - No bonuses are paid.

   B. Single Highest Bid
      - That player wins the auction amount, adding it to their stock.
      - Then they must pay a bonus equal to the difference between their bid and the second-highest bid.
      - If several players tie for second, the bonus is split equally among them (rounding down per player).

   C. If the Winner Cannot Pay the Bonus
      - The winnings are not kept.
      - In 3–6 players: their stock is reduced to 0.
      - In 2 players: their stock stays the same (not reduced).
      - That player is removed from the auction, and the next-highest bidder attempts to resolve as the new winner.
      - Continue until someone can pay, or only one player remains.
      - If only one remains, they gain all the winnings and pay no bonus.

End of the Game:
- The game ends at the end of a round in which at least one player has 200+ stock.
- The player(s) with the most bananas win.
- Ties are shared victories.
